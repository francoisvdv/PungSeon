As a draft for our use case specification we came up with the following use cases.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Play round
	\item Edit options
	\item Check how to play
	\item Check highscores
	\item Quit game
	\item Move
	\item Pick up flag
	\item Activate block
	\item Fire weapon
	\item Deliver flag
\end{enumerate}

These were our first ideas of what users would want to do with the game. To visualize our ideas further, we decided to make sequence diagrams of the basic actions the game should perform as a result of what the users wants to do. Therefore, we created the following use-case sequence diagrams:

Later on, we decided to split play round into two use cases, namely 'Join Match' and 'Create Match'.
